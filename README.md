# PlayableOgre
Mod for Baldur's Gate 3 that allows you to play as a Ogre. Based on the great work of ShinyHobo and the great tutorial video by Padme4000, https://linktr.ee/dungeonsandsouls helped me fixed some issues. Check them out on the discord of Larian Studios.

Currently it overrides the Fighter class to give the Ogre a Weapon of the right size and Hide Armor. Know issue is the Jumping animation and the Portrait bugging.
